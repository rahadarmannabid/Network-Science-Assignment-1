## Network Science Assignemnt-2 Codes and Figures

You can run all the notebook in jupyter notebook. Some code may give error in mac m2 laptops. So I highly suggested to use linux system to run the codes. However, I used pymnet for showing visualization in problem 1 and rest of the problem is solved by networkx 
  
## Problem Description

Problem 1. [Visualizing a Multilayer Network] In this exercise your job is to visualize a 3-layer course network, 
where  nodes  represent  students,  and  each  layer  corresponds  to  a  single  topic  network  representing  one  type  of 
relationship among students taking this course (e.g. in layer 1 nodes representing two students should be connected 
if both students took a Data Mining/Machine Learning course). Note: you need to convert row data to graph format 
edge list or matrix, .csv or .txt format should be fine. Make a screenshot of your visualized networks. 
 
Problem 2. [Visualizing a Weighted Network] Visualize a network obtained by projecting the 3-layer network 
from Problem 1 to a single-layer weighted network, where two students are linked by a weighted edge representing 
the number of topics both students took. 
 
Problem 3. [Visualization of a Bipartite Network] Visualize a bipartite students-topics network where an edge 
between a student node and a topic node exists if and only if this student has taken a course on that topic.

Problem  4.  [Computing  Global  Network  Properties]  For  each  layer  of  the  3-layer  network  constructed  in 
Problem 1 compute and explain the following global network properties: 
a) the size and diameter of the network largest connected component  
b) degree distribution (you can report average degree distribution or plot degree distribution histogram) 
c) average path length 
d) average clustering coefficient 
Repeat this for the network constructed in Problem 2. Compare between properties of each layer and aggregated 
network in Problem 2.
